<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>My emphasis on service to the university and community as part of my professional portfolio has grown over the last couple years.  As the following narrative will demonstrate, many of the activities and leadership opportunities I have assumed have taken place during the latter portion of my probationary period.</p>

<p>Specifically, I have served the university and community through:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="#dept">Participating in and leading department committees</a></li>
<li><a href="#univ">Serving on university-wide committees</a></li>
<li><a href="#scc">Directing the statistical consulting center</a></li>
<li><a href="#training">Running campus training sessions</a></li>
<li><a href="#sdss">Helping to organize the 2019 Symposium on Statistics and Data Science</a></li>
</ol>

<p><a name="dept"></a>
<br></p>

<h2 id="br"><br></h2>

<hr />

<h2 id="i-participated-in-and-led-department-committees">I participated in and led department committees</h2>

<p><a href="#">Back to top </a></p>

<p>A snapshot of the math/stat department committees in which I have participated are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>2015-16: Statistics faculty search committee</li>
<li>2015-present: Student Opportunities and Social Activities Committee (SOSA)</li>
<li>2016-present: Recruitment committee (chair)</li>
</ul>

<p>During the 2015-16 search, I was part of the committee that bought in our newest probationary faculty member, Todd Iverson.</p>

<p>As part of SOSA, I have helped to evaluate and award department scholarships and create protocol for student travel support.  I have also helped to organize our annual spaghetti dinner and awards ceremony and host our fall picnic.</p>

<p>The recruitment committee was formed in Fall 2016, and I have served as the chair of this committee since its inception.  This committee has been very active in recruiting prospective students, and we have seen an increase in incoming first-year students declaring majors in our department.  As chair of this committee, in addition to calling meeting, I worked with Creative Services to develop two post-cards to send to prospective students who had declared interest in majors within our department.  One of these featured a photograph of four current (at the time) students, which I took outside Gildemeister.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="../../files/postcard1.png">Post card #1</a></li>
<li><a href="../../files/postcard2.pdf">Post card #2</a></li>
</ul>

<p>In conjunction with the post cards, I have worked to <a href="../../files/Recruitment_Shirt.jpg">design t-shirts</a> that we now send to all students who have been admitted to Winona State with a stated interested in one of the programs in our department.  When these students visit campus, the recruitment committee hosts <a href="../../files/Student-Admit-Day-2-2-18.pdf">informational sessions</a> about our programs and campus-wide opportunities.</p>

<p>The recruitment committee has also held numerous recruitment workshops.  In October 2017, I worked with Brett Veninga (a connection through MinneAnalytics) to bring several high school students to Winona State for a data anlytics learning experience.  This event consisted of a student case study data analysis, a student panel, and presentation (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kG1dG7-m_2E&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">link to video of event</a>).  The recruitment committee also organized the first-annual <a href="../../files/math_in_real_world.pdf">Math in the Real World</a> workshop which took place during the October 2018 University Improvement Day.  This workshop brought in over 40 students from local high schools to participate in brief, interactive workshop sessions hosted by the department faculty (<a href="../../files/Workshop_Abstracts.pdf">link to session descriptions</a>).  Overall the committee felt the first iteration was a great success and we plan to improve upon it in future years.  Below are some comments from high school teachers regarding the workshop:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Students (and teachers) were made aware of the fact that if you are good at math and/or enjoy it, there are math fields other than teaching or engineering that are relevant and exciting!</em></p>

<p><em>I thought it was tremendous!</em></p>

<p><em>Students were given real-life examples of where the math they are/will be learning can be used to solve problems. Workshops were great as professors weren&rsquo;t using too complex of math concepts, high school students who maybe aren&rsquo;t entirely in love with math or A+ students are still able to follow along and get something out of it.</em></p>

<p><em>I really enjoyed what you all did for putting this on for a first time. Workshops were perfect length, the ones we went to were relatable to stuff students have seen or will be seeing in their classes and in the world around them.</em></p>

<h2 id="i-served-on-university-wide-committees">I served on university-wide committees</h2>

<p><a href="#">Back to top </a></p>

<p>I have served on three all-campus committees during my probationary period:</p>

<ul>
<li>Grade appeals committee</li>
<li>Lyceum committee</li>
<li>Student affairs committee</li>
</ul>

<p>My membership is current on all of these committee.  I value these opportunities not only for the experience and service, but as chances to meet faculty and staff and develop collaborations that I might not otherwise.</p>

<h2 id="br-2"><br></h2>

<hr />

<h2 id="i-directed-the-statistical-consulting-center">I directed the Statistical Consulting Center</h2>

<p><a href="#">Back to top </a></p>

<p>I took over the duty of directing the Statistical Consulting Center (SCC) in Spring Semester 2018.  Directing the SCC has afforded me the opportunity to meet and assist a wide variety of students and faculty.  In the table below I list all the clients I have served either directly or in a supervisory capacity.  This list is a subset clients for whom I have either done statistical analysis and written a report or provided training; a list of all clients I have served in smaller capacities would be much longer!  Some of these service opportunities have also resulted in <a href="../crit2/#articles">peer-reviewed publications</a>.  Asterisks (*) denote clients that were served as part of the STAT 370 statistical consulting course I taught in Fall 2018 (I talk in more detail about the STAT 370 course in particular in my <a href="../crit1/#stat370">Criterion 1 narrative</a>).  For these clients, students prepared reports and presentations under my supervision.  Thus, not only has directing the SCC allowed me to serve the university and community, it has provided a channel for students to do the same as part of a valuable learning experience.</p>

<p>Following Fall Semester 2018, I sent out a Qualtrics survey to all clients who were served by the SCC either by me directly or through the STAT 370 class.  I received 10 responses.  All 10 respondents &ldquo;Strongly Agreed&rdquo; with the statement <em>I would recommend the SCC to colleagues</em>.  In addition, some of the clients provided the following written feedback:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>The SCC members were professional throughout the entirety of this project. Notes were taken and questions were asked. Students were open and interested in the research, and wanted to understand their role in the process to aid in whichever way I needed. THANK YOU.</em></p>

<p><em>The students were professional, the analysis was completed in a timely manner and students provided a nice power point with graphs to depict the results.</em></p>

<p><em>In general I really appreciate the SCC and what is offered. I enjoy site/class visits that I can learn along with the students, and that Silas is there to keep everything accurate and on track. This is an extremely valuable asset to WSU and in my opinion it should be maintained with dedicated faculty time by all means necessary.</em></p>

<p><em>I found the consultants to be professional and excited to be of assistance. Furthermore, they were committed to helping their client</em></p>

<p><em>I really appreciated the help from the consulting center. It was nice to work with students as well since they are learning the same way we are. I also really appreciated the second meeting since I was unable to attend the presentation by the students due to illness. The flexibility was nice for me.</em></p>

<p><em>The SCC did amazing work on my DNP project! Tom and Stacey were in charge of my project and really took the time to understand what I was looking for. They were attentive to my questions and made adjustments accordingly. The box plot they chose to utilize provided an excellent opportunity to not only look at length of orientation in hours, but demonstrated the variability in each population as well. Satisfaction scores were also depicted nicely. I have used their work in my manuscript and plan to submit it to a professional nursing journal for possible publication. My clinical site was very happy with their work and that makes me very happy! I recommended this course to other classmates in the DNP program. Great class and great work!</em></p>

<p><em>I thought you were very professional in your face to face interactions and e-mail correspondence. Everything was done in a timely manner.</em></p>

<p>In August 2017 I helped to organize a <a href="https://ntmoore.github.io/2017-08-14-winona/" target="_blank">software carpentry workshop</a> for Winona State faculty and students. I specifically wrote and led the portion of the workshop focused on <a href="https://wsu-datascience.github.io/R-ecology-lesson/04-visualization-ggplot2.html" target="_blank">data visualization with the R package ggplot2</a>.</p>

<p>Each year between 2015-2018 I also led the Fundamentals of Engineering statisics review session for engineering majors.  In each two-hour session I would lead the students through a <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/kpumzm47vgnb09q/Stats%20review.docx?dl=0" target="_blank">set of problems</a> to help them prepare for their FE exam.</p>

<p><a href="#">Back to top </a></p>

<p>In Summer 2018, Dr. Kelly McConville from Reed College asked me to help co-organize the data visualization track of the <a href="https://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/sdss/2019/" target="_blank">2019 Symposium on Statistics and Data Science</a> in Bellevue, Washington.  She had me in mind to help organize the symposium since seeing my <a href="https://www.causeweb.org/cause/webinar/teaching/2016-12" target="_blank">2016 webinar</a> on teaching data visualization.  Co-organizing the data visualization track entails organizing invited sessions and invited session organizers and grouping contributed abstracts into cohesive sessions.  I am very excited for the <a href="https://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/sdss/2019/onlineprogram/Program.cfm?TrackID=27" target="_blank">excellent slate of sessions</a> we have on tap for the data visualization session.</p>
