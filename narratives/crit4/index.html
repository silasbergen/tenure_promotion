<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Of the five criterion narratives, this the one I have most been looking forward to writing.  In many ways, my desire to invest in a career centered around teaching was (and is) fueled by an excitement about making a significant and positive difference in the lives of students during a formative period of their life&rsquo;s arc.  Much of this happens in the classroom, but there is so much that takes place outside the classroom walls: in my office, in a van on the way to a field trip, over a celebratory beer at the final semester&rsquo;s end, in the time spend crafting a letter on whose wings the recipient wiltoward graduate school.  To the students I have had the pleasure of shaping in some way, and who have left their indelible mark on me, I dedicate this narrative.</p>

<h2 id="outline">Outline</h2>

<p>The following are the primary categories of ways I have contributed to student growth and development:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="#trips">Leading student professional development trips</a></li>
<li><a href="#comps">Advising student participation in regional and national competitions</a></li>
<li><a href="#letters">Writing letters of recommendation</a></li>

<h2 id="i-led-professional-development-trips">I led professional development trips</h2>

<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

<p>Taking students on trips to outside organizations that routinely utilize quantitative analytics is one of my favorite aspects of my job.  Not only do I enjoy the experience of listening to professionals talk about the &lsquo;real world&rsquo; of data analytics, I also greatly enjoy the informal conversations I have with students to and from the events.  The following are trips I have led or co-led during my probationary period.</p>

<p><strong><em>Trane Industries; October 2014</em></strong><br />
This visit took place on University Improvement Day in October 2014.  This was a great chance for students to see how statistics are applied in the &ldquo;real world.&rdquo;  I drove one of the vehicles we took to the Twin Cities, and enjoyed the chance to chat with students in my vehicle about their experiences in the Math/Stat department and their plans for the future.</p>

<p><strong><em>University of Minnesota&rsquo;s Department of Biostatistics Open House; October 2015</em></strong>
The University of Minnesota&rsquo;s Department of Biostatistics periodically hosts open houses for prospective students to hear about the biostatistics graduate program, meet their faculty, and tour the department.  I took 4 students to this event, and it was a very enjoyable and informative experience for the students.</p>

<p><strong><em>SportCon sports analytics conference, January 2017</em></strong></p>

<p>Hosted by MinneAnalytics, SportCon was a conference centered on providing data solutions in sports contexts.  I took 5 students to this conference.</p>

<p><strong><em>St. Olaf University; February 2018</em></strong></p>

<p>Dr. Julie Legler from St. Olaf contacted me in February 2018.  She had encountered <a href="https://iase-web.org/documents/papers/rt2016/Bergen.pdf" target="_blank">the paper</a> I gave at the IASE roundtable in Berlin in 2016, and was interested in the work I have done implementing large data sets with social justice themes in my statistics and data science courses.  After corresponding with her, she invited me to bring some WSU students who had been working on class projects that used this data to present their work to her research workshop class.</p>

<p>I wrote <a href="http://driftlessdata.space/post/about-social-justice/" target="_blank">a blog post</a> about this experience, and also thanks to encouragement from Dr. Legler, <a href="http://driftlessdata.space/project/social-justice-data/" target="_blank">compiled all the resources</a> I&rsquo;ve used over the years.</p>

<p><strong><em>Minnesota Twins baseball operations; November 2018</em></strong></p>

<p>In November 2018, Chris Malone and I took nine students to visit the Minnesota Twins&rsquo; baseball operations.  I organized this trip after reaching out to Director of Baseball Operations Daniel Adler, who graciously agreed to host us for a couple on a Friday morning to hold a Q&amp;A session with students.  This was a fantastic sneak peak behind the curtain of how a Major League front office makes evidence-based decisions on trades, player development, and drafting. One of the perks of the visit was a personal tour of Target Field in the offseason!</p>

<p>I take very seriously the responsibility and privilege of writing letters of recommendation for our students.  These letters are the wings on which our students &ldquo;fly the nest&rdquo; and move on to the next stage of their careers in the workforce or graduate school.  Below is a list of the students for whom I have written letters during my probationary period. Often I am able to offer support at multiple times and places along a student&rsquo;s journey.</p>

<p><em>WINSTATS REU</em></p>

<p>Prior to Summer 2017, I spearheaded a successful application for Winona State University to host a 10-week Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) in collaboration with Chris Malone and Brant Deppa. The REU was awarded by the American Statistical Association (ASA) through a competitive application process, and provided funding and support to bring 4 undergraduate students to learn about data analysis as a science and profession.  Winona State was one of only 9 universities total (3 each for Summers 2016, 2017, and 2018) to be awarded this REU, which was intended to encourage women, minorities, and persons with disabilities to learn more about STEM fields. (<a href="http://magazine.amstat.org/blog/2018/09/01/reu18/" target="_blank">More details at this ASA blog post</a>.) We began recruiting for our REU in August 2016 and received over 30 very strong applications from students nationwide.  We ultimately extended invitations to 4 exceptional students who all accepted our invitation.</p>

<p>Students partnered with researchers at the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series International (IPUMS-I) to develop data products and visualizations for IPUMS-I users. Two students worked primarily on using multiple correspondence analysis to develop an index of household wealth, while the other two worked on an interactive data visualization to summarize basic demographic information for countries of interest to IPUMS-I users. Both projects required a great deal of data cleaning after extracting the microdata from the IPUMS-I query service.</p>

<p>Along with their research, the students took several professional development trips to learn about applications of data analytics in the workplace. These included visits to Mayo Clinic, Be the Match, Optum, the Wilder Foundation, and the Minnesota Wild.  They also visited the University of Iowa statistics and biostatistics graduate programs.</p>

<p>At the end of the summer, the students traveled to Baltimore to present their research at the 2017 Joint Statistical Meetings.</p>

<li><a href="http://driftlessdata.space/files/JSM_Poster_Presentation.jpg" target="_blank">JSM poster presentation #2</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I have continued to stay in touch with and support these students as they continue their professional development.  One of the students went on to pursue a master&rsquo;s degree at University of Iowa after visiting there during the REU.  I am also currently in the recommendation-writing cycle for one of the other students who hopes to pursue a PhD in statistics.</p>

<p>Below are responses from the students about their experience from a post-REU survey:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Visiting all the companies and the grad school really helped put the career of a statistician in perspective for me. Also, the support from faculty was really great.</em></p>

<p><em>How much individual instruction and attention we got from all of the professors. There were four students total, and we worked with four professors, which seems unheard of. You all also really cared about us and wanted to get to know us. I loved going to the pizza farm and Silas&rsquo;s house and getting to know your families. We also got to know you all as people by joking around in our classroom and asking about each other&rsquo;s lives, which I also think is less common. - Going on the professional development trips. I think those opportunities were what helped me see the route I want to take in my career. I could hear that I needed a lot of statistics to do the coolest stuff at the organizations we visited, and could ask about how many people had graduate degrees and which kinds. Seeing the application of data analytics in various fields was probably the most helpful thing for me this summer. - Living with the other REU students. It&rsquo;s been so nice to have friends to hang out with each evening in our apartment. It would be lonely otherwise. I would say a PI should always suggest the students live together. - Learning SO MUCH STATS at the beginning. I loved getting to hear about so many areas of statistics and also having to practice the skills we were learning about - I feel that I actually have an ok handle on a wide range of statistical topics, all because of your instruction (I&rsquo;ve had no statistics previously, but was able to make my way using MCA for research, do the tasks during the instruction, etc.)</em></p>

<p><em>There was a strong feeling of community - the faculty really cared about us as students and as individuals. It was a fast-paced learning environment in which I felt challenged and excited to learn more concepts. Rooming with Megan and Eva was a great decision - it was so fun to get to them as friends instead of just coworkers. I loved the town of Winona! It was very welcoming, with lots of outdoor activities and fun places to explore. We did meaningful research with questions about something more than maximizing profit. I really liked using IPUMS data because it had so much complexity and so much information. The work was very flexible - I was able to work where I was most comfortable and at the times I preferred. The professional development trips were so eye opening - I feel like I have a much better idea of what I want to do now. They also gave us a chance to change it up a bit and get out of the same place for a few days, which kept it even more interesting. The learning modules at the beginning taught me so much real statistical knowledge that I feel way more prepared for my upper level statistics courses. The trip to Baltimore was a great end to the REU! It was so much fun and was a great networking experience. Plus, it really gave us something to prepare for and made us really put our findings in a comprehensible display.</em></p>

<p><em>The REU was a great experience. I think the most beneficial part was getting a taste for what the field is actually like. The trips we took to various companies gave me insight into potential job opportunities for the future. The grad school visit was also helpful. I learned a lot about grad school in general by talking to the biostatistics and statistics departments at the University of Iowa. The grad school visit along with the visits to companies in the public health sector such as Optum, Mayo Clinic, and Be The Match sparked my interest in biostatistics which I hadn&rsquo;t put much thought into before. Before this summer, I had only analyzed a few basic data sets in R so I didn&rsquo;t have any depth of knowledge on what statisticians actually do. Learning concepts in R for data science and learning about regression and how to clean data was extremely helpful. I was also not familiar with Tableau or the dplyr package which both proved themselves to be useful in the research I did this summer. I also loved living with the other student researchers. They acted as a support system while in Winona. The friendship we formed was special and I think we will stay in contact for years to come. Winona is also the perfect place to spend a summer. The area is beautiful and I enjoyed spending time with the faculty outside of work. I was pleased with each member of our group and I enjoyed working with each and everyone of the researchers and professors.</em></p>

<p><strong><em>If the WINSTATS REU were to be repeated, would you recommend other students to apply?  Why/why not?</em></strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Yes, I would recommend this experience to other students without any hesitation. I feel like I acquired more knowledge this summer than I had in the previous year at school. The professional experiences and conferences are far beyond anything most students would experience in a University setting.</em></p>

<p><em>Yes, I would. Winona is a very pleasant town in which to spend the summer, the professors make you feel very welcome and comfortable, and it&rsquo;s fun to get to go up to the cities frequently. I felt very happy spending my summer in Minnesota. The WINSTATS REU also gave us so much one-on-one attention with the professors - we got valuable training and advice promptly and consistently, and were able to develop strong relationships with our advisers that I hope will remain strong into the future. The professional development trips exposed us to a wide range of professional settings - nonprofit, large corporation, research university/hospital, sports team, etc, and I learned about jobs I didn&rsquo;t even knew existed. From response to Chris: Overall, the positives FAR outweigh the negatives. We were compensated extremely well for this research program, so the expenses we incurred aren&rsquo;t a huge deal. I&rsquo;ve learned so much about myself, the field of data science/statistics, and what I want to do with my education in the next few years, all because of the work you all put in to make connections for us, find us opportunities, and teach us interesting material. I&rsquo;ve loved this summer, and am sad to see it coming to an end. I&rsquo;ve enjoyed getting to know everyone involved so well, and expect to keep in touch with everyone going forward. Thank you for selecting me for the REU - I feel very thankful to have had this experience.</em></p>

<p><em>I would definitely recommend for other students to apply! I learned so much about what I want to do, how I work best, and tons of statistical concepts. The faculty and other students made it so fun with so many outside activities and events planned. Overall, a great summer and a great experience!</em></p>

<p><em>Yes, absolutely. The professional development offered by the REU was really incredible. Again, I&rsquo;d more enthusiastically recommend this program for students at the freshman/sophomore level and for non-stat majors than juniors/seniors and stat majors. However, I think the REU has opportunities for development for any undergrad. Further, the faculty at Winona is friendly and helpful. I found making those relationships to be very valuable.</em></p>

<h2 id="i-brought-distinguished-speakers-to-winona-state">I brought distinguished speakers to Winona State</h2>

<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

<p>In spring 2015 I wrote a successful application to bring Alan Schwarz to Winona State as a Lyceum speaker.  In compiling the application I garnered letters of support from students in our own department, the Mass Communications department, and the HERS department.  Best-known for his use of quantitative reasoning in his investigative reporting of the NFL concussion cover-ups, Schwarz&rsquo; student Q&amp;A and Lyceum presentation afforded students majoring in mathematics, statistics, and journalism a chance to interact with someone they might not have otherwise.  The students were very engaged during the student Q&amp;A session, so much so that Alan said our students were some of the most engaged he had ever encountered.  It was a very enjoyable visit for all involved.</p>

<p>I am also organizing the math/stat department distinguished speaker for Spring 2019.  We are bringing <a href="http://www.thefunctionalart.com/" target="_blank">Alberto Cairo</a>, author of <em>The Functional Art</em> and Knight Chair in Visual Journalism at the School of Communication of the University of Miami (UM).  He has taught in more than 20 countries. Students in our data science program (especially the data visualization course) will greatly benefit from Alberto&rsquo;s visit.</p>
