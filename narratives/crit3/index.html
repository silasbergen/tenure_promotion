<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>I have learned so much during my probationary period at Winona State!  One of the aspects of my job for which I am so grateful is the daily opportunity to learn.  &ldquo;Boredom&rdquo; is unfortunately a common companion for many people at their work; I am so gratified to say I am not one of these people.  In the following narrative I will provide evidence of ways in which I have continued to learn and grow as a professional in my field.</p>

<p>As I reflected on the professional development activities I undertook during my probationary period, I was struck by how things that I learned during my early years have become mainstays of my current professional practice.  Accordingly I have decided to organize this narrative chronologically: each of the following sections is an academic year.  My intent here is not merely to list the articles I have read or the conferences I attended over the years, but to give specific examples of ways the preparation and study I undertook influenced my practice to this day.</p>

<ol>
<li>2014-2015</li>
<li>2015-2016</li>
<li>2016-2017</li>
<li>2017-2018</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="2014-2015">2014-2015</h2>

<p>The study and preparation in which I engaged in 2014-2015 included:</p>

<ul>
<li>Learning the R Markdown environment</li>
<li>Reading the following articles on success (or lack thereof) of the flipped statistics classroom:

<ul>
<li>Winquist JR and Carlson KA. Flipped classroom results: better performance than lecture over one year later. Journal of Statistical Education. Volume 22, Number 3. 2014.</li>
<li>Gundlach E, Richards KAR, Nelson D, and Levesque-Bristol C.  A comparison of attitudes, statistical reasoning, performance, and perceptions for web-augmented traditional, fully online, and flipped sections of a statistical literacy class.  Journal of Statistical Education. Volume 23, Number 1.  2015.<br />
<br /></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="learning-the-r-markdown-environment">Learning the R Markdown environment</h4>

<p>In my 2014-15 PDR, I wrote the following:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I was very excited to finally learn R Markdown this past year.  R Markdown is a functionality within R Studio, and is a way to very nicely reproduce R code and output within the body of a document.  I had heard about R Markdown in graduate school, but never made time to learn it.  This year I intended to use R in STAT 310 and so finally got down to learning R Markdown as a way of teaching R to my students. Using R Markdown, I made a document introducing R to my STAT 310 students and walking them through the R commands necessary to complete a Homework problem.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is striking in reading this that at one point I did <em>not</em> use R Markdown!  I use it almost daily now: from preparing course notes to writing reports for statistical consulting clients.  R Markdown is so prominently featured in statistical report writing that I have made it an integral part of the writing component of the STAT 450/460 sequence, which is a writing intensive.  See the relevant section from the <a href="../crit1/#sec7">Criterion 1 narrative</a> for examples of R Markdown use in Stat 450/460.  Some more recent examples from this course, as well as examples of statistical consulting reports developed using R Markdown, are provided below:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>STAT 450 assignments requiring use of R Markdown (Fall 2018)</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/scj6w5tyxug2odq/HW1_KEY.pdf?dl=0" target="_blank">Example 1: Key to HW assignment 1</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/httefljmt9sxuc6/HW2-KEY.pdf?dl=0" target="_blank">Example 2: Key to HW assignment 2; note blend of mathematical notation, R code, and computer graphics characteristic of a document rendered with R Markdown</a></li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>Statistical consulting reports developed with R Markdown</p>

</ul></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="studying-the-literature-on-flipped-classrooms">Studying the literature on flipped classrooms</h4>

<p>As early as my first year I was already considering the flipped classroom model, wherein students learn the content outside class and spend the in-class time problem-solving and applying the course material.  In 2014-2015 I was already laying the groundwork towards flipping, and reading articles that studied the merits of flipping.  I gradually began to flip the STAT 110 classroom; efforts that I have <a href="../crit1/#flipit">described in much more detail in my Criterion 1 narrative</a>.</p>

<h2 id="2015-2016">2015-2016</h2>

<p>My highlights from the 2015-2016 period included:</p>

<ul>
<li>Learning software tools <a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/" target="_blank"><code>ggplot2</code></a> and <a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/" target="_blank"><code>dplyr</code></a> in <code>R</code></li>
<li>Learning data visualization software Tableau</li>
<li>Attending impactful talks at professional conferences</li>
</ul>

<p>My primary professional development in 2015-2016 involved learning software that is central to much of the data science curricula we now teach.  Specifically, I solidified my understanding of the <code>R</code> tools <a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/" target="_blank"><code>dplyr</code></a> and <a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/" target="_blank"><code>ggplot2</code></a> and the Tableau software package.  <a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/" target="_blank"><code>dplyr</code></a> is a data wrangling package and <a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/" target="_blank"><code>ggplot2</code></a> a data visualization package; I use both extensively both in my own practice and <a href="http://driftlessdata.space/courses/dsci310/ipums-visualization-ggplot/" target="_blank">in my</a> <a href="http://driftlessdata.space/courses/dsci310/ipums-visualization-key/" target="_blank">courses</a>.  Learning Tableau for the first time was fundamental as part of teaching the DSCI 310 course for the first time in Fall 2015.  See <a href="https://public.tableau.com/profile/silas.bergen#!/" target="_blank">my Tableau Public profile</a> for a sampling of the data visualizations I and my students have created with Tableau.</p>

<p>It was August 2015 that I heard a talk by Dennis Sun at the Joint Statistical Meetings on student peer evaluation in statistics courses.  I have described this experience <a href="../crit1/#crowdgrader">in more detail in my Criterion 1 narrative</a>.  I consider this experience and what I learned from it an instrumental part of my professional development during academic year 2015-16.</p>

<h2 id="2016-2017">2016-2017</h2>

<p>Highlights from 2016-2017 included:</p>

<ul>
<li>Attending the IASE roundtable Promoting understanding of statistics about society in July 2016</li>
<li>Attending Todd Iverson&rsquo;s Special Topics Python course for part of Spring Semester 2017</li>
</ul>

<p>The International Association of Statistics Education (IASE) roundtable I attended in Berlin, Germany was an especially unique and positive experience.  It was fantastic to be exposed to the approaches and methods taken by statistical educators from around the world.  Over dinner and drinks, we would dialogue about the different challenges faced in different environments.  As the roundtable theme was on promoting understanding of statistics about society, we had many conversations about how crucial statistics are in the current socio-political climate, from Brexit to Donald Trump to the alt-right movement in Germany and across Europe and the U.S.  At this roundtable, I met and developed a collaboration with Lara Cleveland from the International Public Use Microdata Series-International (IPUMS-I).  Ironically, Lara is based in the Twin Cities metro area, but we never met until gathering in Berlin.  Leveraging this connection, my colleagues and I wrote an application to the American Statistical Association to bring 4 undergraduates from across the United States to Winona State for a 10-week research experience for undergraduates (REU) for Summer 2017.  This experience is <a href="#">described in more detail in my Criterion 4 narrative</a>.</p>

<p>Python is rapidly becoming an industry standard for data science, and I was eager to learn about its functionality by sitting in on Todd&rsquo;s DSCI 489: Special Topics class this semester.  While I had to stop attending midway through as the semester grew busy, what I was able to attend was extremely beneficial.  It definitely scratched the itch I had to be exposed to and learn some Python.  I even <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/gauofewem1huo9n/HW4-code.py?dl=0" target="_blank">completed an entire homework assignment</a>!</p>

<h2 id="2017-2018">2017-2018</h2>

<p>During this year I continuted to teach myself software tools, most prominently <a href="https://gohugo.io/" target="_blank">Hugo</a>, an open-source website building tool.  I used this tool to build a <a href="http://driftlessdata.space/" target="_blank">new personal website</a> where I could host course materials and the occasional blog post (I consider it a &ldquo;professional diary&rdquo; of sorts), as well as the website you are currently using to read this portfolio.</p>
